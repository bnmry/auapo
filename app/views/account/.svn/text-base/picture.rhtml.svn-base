<h4>Set a picture</h4>
<p>Upload a picture of yourself to add some color and personality to events.  This picture should be a close-up of your face and will be displayed next to your name on event listings and top 10 lists.  Also, there will soon be a fraternity composite for the public to see.  So, make sure your picture is good and that we can see your face!  <strong>It's best if it's a square picture with equal height and width.</strong></p>
